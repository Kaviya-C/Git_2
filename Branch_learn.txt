Here we can learn about branch in git


create one branch in git

named as branch_1

now come to vs code terminal

type
git branch 

here it shows some branch name

first time if we type mean it shows only main

bcoz we have to pull
then only whatever changes done in git platform that will be visible here

so type
git pull

now type
git branch -a

now we can see our own created branch in this terminal

currently am in main branch
if want to change the branch 

type
git  checkout branch_1

this command will help us to switch into this branch_1

after this add , commit push 

when pushing we should take care of origin as 
git push origin branch_1

we should give the branch name what we currently presents

now go and refresh the page there we can see the file of branch_learn.txt in branch_1

but in main branch this file is not visible

if u want this file should be visible to the main branch also then follow below steps


type
git checkout main

vs code see the folder that branch_learn file is not there

when we type git checkout branch_1
now that branch_learn file is visible

how to send this branch_learn.txt to main?????

switch into main branch

type:
git diff branch_1

it tells this is the difference message will shown

type:
git merge branch_1

this will connect main to branch_1

git push origin main

**** MAKE SURE  SWITCH INTO  MAIN THEN MERGE ****

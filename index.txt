create one folder in local machine

create one file inside that folder

in that folder location change the path in terminal using cd command


after coming to that location of created folder path 

go to file explorer in system there check is git folder is there inside of ur created folder inside

 .git folder is not there

 bcoz now only we create that folder 
we have to initiate the git inside that folder for that  we can use command as: 


git init

this will intiate the .git folder in our created folder path

after that we can check the git status

now it shows index.txt is untracked

git add .   <------>  meant for adding all the files in the local machine into git platform

git add index.txt ----> 
git commit -m "NewFolderToGit"

here we have to be careful  bcoz we are in new folder path
we can't use directly origin main to push  
git push origin main

instead of using that command create one repository new copy that origin path url 

type
git remote add origin paste that url 

now type git branch here we can see the branch name as master


git push origin main 
this comment won't work

USE ANY ONE OF THE BELOW


one:
git push origin master

two:
change the branch name as
git branch -M main


after changing the branch 
git push origin main

now all the folder and files are pushed in the git platform
